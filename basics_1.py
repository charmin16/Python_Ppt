#Exercise: Write a program for a hospital, we check in a patient's name John Smith. He's 20yrs
#old and a new patient. Define three variables for his name, his age, and another variable to 
#tell if he's a new or existing patient

#Patient_name = 'John Smith' #stating the patient's name
#Patient_age =  20 #stating the patient's age
#is_new = True #stating the patients status whether new or existing

#Getting inputs
#my_name = raw_input('What is your name? ')
#print('Hello ' + my_name )

#Ask two questions: person's name and favourite color, then print a msg like
#Isabella likes purple.

#name = raw_input('What is your name? ')
#favourite_color = raw_input('What is your favourtie color? ')
#print(name + ' likes ' + favourite_color)

#Type Conversion
#Write a program to write the year we were born in, then it will calculate our age
#and put it on the terminal

#birth_year = raw_input('Birth year: ')
#age = 2021 - birth_year #This is definitely goin to give you an error msg because
# 2021 is an integer and birth_year is a string. For the operation to work, the string has
# to be converted to integer as shown below
#age = 2021 - int(birth_year)
#print(age)

#birth_year = raw_input('Birth year: ')
#print(type(birth_year))
#print(type(age))

#Exercise: Ask a user their weight (in pounds), convert it to kilograms and print on the terminal

#user_weight = raw_input('What is your weight in pounds: ')
#weight_kg = float(user_weight)/2.2
#print(weight_kg)
