#print( 10 / 3 ) # Division operation, it will return a floating number: 3.33333..
#print( 10 // 3) # Division operation that returns an integer: 3
#print( 10 % 3 ) # Returns the remainder of the division operation which is 1

#Alternatively
#x = 10

#print(x)
#x -= 3 # The value of x is x -3
#print(x)
#x *= 3 # The value of x(meanwhile x is now 7) is x*3

#x /=3  # The new value of x is now 21.  This will return x/3
